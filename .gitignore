### **Step 2: How to Run and Deploy**

1.  **Install Dependencies:** Open your terminal in the `TrackOPM` project folder and run:
    ```bash
    npm install
    2.  **Run Locally:** To see the dashboard on your computer, run:
    ```bash
    npm start
    3.  **Deploy to Netlify:**
    * Push all your new code to GitHub.
    * Go to your Netlify settings. Based on your screenshot, your settings should be:
        * **Base directory:** (leave this blank)
        * **Build command:** `npm run build`
        * **Publish directory:** `build`
    * Trigger a new deploy.

This will get your new, fully-featured dashboard up and running!
