## 1) Clone & install
npm i


## 2) Configure environment
Copy `.env.sample` to Netlify > Site settings > Environment variables:
- VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY, VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN, VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID

- VITE_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID (optional)
- GEMINI_API_KEY (server-only)


## 3) Netlify Function setup
This repo includes `netlify/functions/gemini.js`. Netlify will auto-detect.


## 4) Build & run
npm run dev # local
npm run build # production bundle (no unsafe-eval)


## 5) Deploy on Netlify
Connect repo → set env vars → Deploy. SPA redirects and CSP are in netlify.toml.


## 6) Use
- Sign in with Google
- Open Standards Planner
- Generate with Gemini
- Save to Firestore (assignments collection)
- Clear/Back/Exit buttons included


## Notes
- No localStorage; Firestore is the source of truth.
- CSP is strict (no unsafe-eval). Avoid injecting 3rd-party scripts that require it.
- If you add Firebase Storage/Hosting/etc., update `connect-src` in CSP accordingly.
